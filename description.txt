Parts:

The world -- static -- has background and some obstacles
  Bacground: just a plain color, for example, black
  Obstacles:
    a) walls -- each wall is a line having start and end coordinates, and RGBA color.
    b) polygons -- collections > 3 dots, connected with continuous line, with RGBA color,


The agent -- mobile -- can move forward and backward, left and right, and rotate left and right.
  Agent itself can have a complex shape consisting from polygons and lines.
  The agent's movement is impeded by obstacles.
  Key bindings:
    W - forward
    S - backward
    A - left translation
    D - right translation
    Q - left rotation
    E - right rotation

Agent's view -- a strip rendering what the agent sees.


Two renderers:
  1 - a top view of the world with agent in it.
    All static objects are pre-rendered, and this pre-rendered view then serves as backdrop

  2 - a strip view from agents perspective.
